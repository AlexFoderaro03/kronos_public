> This project is made in Python, a simple but extremely effective language. 
Through libraries, we were able to implement an anti bot system, 
which most of the times will not require you to complete any of them.
Furthermore we do support google login and with our oneclick tool you 
can easily increment your captcha score visible [here](https://recaptcha-demo.appspot.com/recaptcha-v3-request-scores.php)
